NAME
	Test::Nginx2 - Testing modules for Nginx C module development, with
	community patches

DESCRIPTION
    This is a fork of Test::Nginx with community patches.

    Essential improvements to original Test::Nginx are:

    * Count test-cases by blocks instead of minor tests, no more this:

        repeat_each(3);
        plan tests => blocks() * 3 + 2;

    now you can write in more intuitive way like this:

        repeat_each(3);
        plan tests => scalar(blocks());
